# Level 0, Problem 2
Each year, VandyHacks offers four buses (listed below) to other schools to help transport their hackers to VandyHacks. We release signups for these buses in advance so hackers know that they can get a ride to VandyHacks. To secure a signup, a hacker has to pay a $10 deposit (we refund this if they attend the event). In this problem, you're provided with two CSVs. The first provides details of who paid the deposit and for which route. The second provides details of who showed up at the event. Answer these two questions (with code, not Excel or similar).

1. How much money will VandyHacks make in the form of lost deposits (i.e. noshows)? 
2. Which route provides VandyHacks the best yield (yield is defined as the number of shows divided by number of deposits)?
