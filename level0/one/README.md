# Level 0, Problem 1
At VandyHacks, we use NFC wristbands to check people into meals and events. This gives us a rich dataset we can analyze for trends. In this problem, you'll be working with a similar dataset (note: this isn't real data from VandyHacks). You'll be given a [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) with sample NFC checkin data. Based on that data, *using code* (not Excel or similar), answer these two questions:
1. How many people came between time start and time end?
2. During which hour did the most poeple checkin?
