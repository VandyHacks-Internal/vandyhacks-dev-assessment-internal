# Level 1, Problem 2
Each year, VandyHacks offers four buses (listed below) to other schools to help transport their hackers to VandyHacks. We release signups for these buses in advance so hackers know that they can get a ride to VandyHacks. To secure a signup, a hacker has to pay a $10 deposit (we refund this if they attend the event). In this problem, you're provided with a CSV containing everyone who paid a deposit (assume that everybody who rode the bus paid a deposit). It also contains other relevant details.

## Question
1. How much money will VandyHacks make in the form of lost deposits (i.e. noshows)? 
2. Which route provides VandyHacks the best yield (yield is defined as the number of shows divided by number of deposits)?


## Answer format
For question 1, your answer should be a single integer. Place that answer into a file called `busmoney_one.txt` as just an integer with no special characters (including the dollar sign), no decimal point, no specification of cents, no tabs, no spaces, and no newlines. 

For question 2, your answer should be a single bus route in the form of the codename (specified below). Place your answer into a file called `busmoney_two.txt`. That file should contain one of "GT", "IIT", "Purdue", or "UIUC".
