# Level 0, Problem 2
A common operation that Vaken (our hackathon registration system, open sourced [here](https://github.com/Vandyhacks/vaken)) has to perform is filtering attendees (we refer to them as "hackers") based on specific queries. In this question, you'll be provided sample hacker data in JSON format. 


## Question
How many of the hackers have some sort of dietary restriction? That includes allergies.

## Answer format
Your answer should be in the form of an integer. Place that integer into a file in this folder called `dietary.txt` with no tabs, spaces, newlines or units.
