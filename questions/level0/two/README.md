# Level 0, Problem 2
A fun easter egg that we've included on our website in past year's is a randomly selected and (hopefully!) humerous message at the bottom of the page (like "Made with real cane sugar" or "Made with this one weird trick"). In this problem, you'll be provided with a JSON array of quotes and a number *n*. 

## Question
Randomly select *n* unique statements from the array and return them in a new JSON array.

## Answer format
Take your JSON array and place it into a file in this folder called `random.json`.
