# Level 0, Problem 1
A common operation that Vaken (our hackathon registration system, open sourced [here](https://github.com/Vandyhacks/vaken)) has to perform is filtering hackers based on specific queries. In this question, you'll be provided sample hacker data in JSON format. 

## Question
How many of the hackers can you be sure are from Vanderbilt University? Hint: look at the emails.

## Answer format
Your answer should be in the form of an integer. Place that integer into a file in this folder called `filter.txt` with no tabs, spaces, newlins or units.
