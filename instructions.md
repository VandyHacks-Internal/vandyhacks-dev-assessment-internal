# Welcome

Hi! Thanks for taking the VandyHacks Board Dev Assessment. This repository holds the problems that you'll be doing as part of the process for joining the dev or content teams on VandyHacks Board.

Our process for determining technical competency this year is significantly different than past years. Our goal is that we get a more accurate sense of which skills potential board members already have and what we would need to invest in teaching for new board members this semester. We hope that this new process is more accurate and more fair to candidates. 

Depending on your performance on this assessment (note: we are **not** looking for perfect scores), your application, and your interview, we may invite you for a follow up pair programming interview. We'll send you an email on this!

If at any point, you have questions, please feel free to contact us at dev@vandyhacks.org. We also appreciate comments and feedback on this process.

## How this assessment is structured?

You will have 24 hours to complete this assessment. We are not giving you 24 hours so you can work 24 hours straight on this assessment. We're giving you that amount of time so that you can schedule your own day and build in breaks. 

There are four levels as part of this assessment from level 0 to level 3. Each level is harder than the one that precedes it. As stated above, we are not necessarily looking for pefect scores. Do your best, don't stress out if you can't do a problem, and feel free to skip between problems.

### What resources am I allowed to use?
You are allowed to use any reference material you'd like (including open sourced code on the Internet). If you directly copy code from GitHub or Stackoverflow, you do **not** have to cite it. Real software engineering invovles cleverly reusing others' code - we will not penalize that. 

You are **NOT** allowed to received aid from another person. That includes other candidates applying for board, friends not applying to VandyHacks, Professors, family and so on. Additionally, you are not permitted to solicit help from strangers by posting on StackOverflow or any forum site. 

If you are confused by a question, please email dev@vandyhacks.org for clarification or find a current VandyHacks board member. 
 
Anyone involved in any anuthorized collaboration will be immediately rejected from board. 

After the deadline, feel free to talk to whomever you'd like and share your code wherever you'd like!

## What languages and tools can I use?

Short answer: anything you'd like.

Longer answer: all of the code that VandyHacks uses in production is Javascript (specifically, Typescript). Therefore, we're most interested in applicants who use those languages. Therefore, we will look more favorably on submissions that use Javascript and even more favorably on submissions that use Typescript **BUT** we will accept submissions in any language. We expect to accept some applicants who are not experience in Javascript.
